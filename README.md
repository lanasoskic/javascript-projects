# JavaScript Projects for Beginners

This collection consists of four independent and easy-to-follow JavaScript projects.

## Projects included

**Project 1: Pig Game**

It's a simple game with simple rules for practicing basic DOM manipulations.

#### Game rules:

Player 1 rolls a dice.
  
With every roll a player has to decide whether they want to keep rolling or simply hold the current score.
  
The catch is that every time a player gets 1, all of their score won in that round is now lost, and it's other player's turn. So try not to be greedy!
  
The one who first reaches a total score of 100 wins the game! üèÜ

**Project 4: Mapty**

Mapty is a project used for practicing OOP and the usage of APIs such as Geolocation and localStorage, as well as the open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps created by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

#### Usage:

Click anywhere on the map where you would like to log one out of two possible activities (running or cycling), along with some extra information, then press Enter. After logging few of those, click on the logged data (presented in the black box) and see how the map moves (interacts) according to your need.
